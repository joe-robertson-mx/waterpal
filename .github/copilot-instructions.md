# Agent Execution Rules
- Always prioritize "Build Mode" over "Plan Mode."
- Execute terminal commands (npm, git, make) immediately without asking.
- If a command fails, read the logs and self-correct.
- Do not stop for feedback until the entire feature is functional.
- Use a "chain-of-thought" process: Plan -> Code -> Test -> Fix -> Finish.
